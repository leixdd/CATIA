				<p>On behalf of TESDA Secretary Guiling “Gene” A. Mamondiong, Deputy Director General for Policies and Planning Rosanna A. Urdaneta led a press conference today, July 27, and presented the Agency’s long term plans for thwarting poverty by increasing the marginalized sector’s access to technical vocational education and training (TVET).<br><br>

				Executive Director Marissa Legaspi of the TESDA Planning Office shared with media the Authority’s “Two-pronged Strategy of TESDA in Poverty Reduction”, which are the TVET for Global Competitiveness and TVET for Social Equity, that plans to offer more training services to urban and rural poor, farmers, fisher folks, indigenous people (IPs), women, rebel returnees/combatants, drug dependents, repatriated OFWs, out-of-school youths (OSYs), micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs), family enterprises, and local government units (CTECs).<br><br>

				She also discussed TESDA’s 12-point agenda for the next six years and beyond which includes: Technical Audit; Linkages with Government Schools and Training Institutions; Drug Dependents Training Program; Barangay Skills Training Program; Moral Renewal Program; Linkages with Foreign Skills Training Institutions; Global Access to List of TVET Graduates and Certified Workers; Continuing Program for TESDA’s Alumni; Expanded Training Program for Women; Special Skills Training for Individual and Family Enterprises; Establishment of On-line Scholarship Application; and Transparency.<br><br>

				DDG Urdaneta clarified that aside from the training given by more than 4,000 TVET providers in the country, TESDA plans to bolster its training efforts using approaches such as community-based training, expanded scholarships, Mobile Training Program, TESDA Online Program, Barangay Empowerment thru TVET, CMUs (Compact Mobile Units) and Onsite Training and Assessment.<br><br>

				The Deputy Chief added that the 12-point agenda would serve as the framework on which programs designed specifically for expanded access to TVET by the identified groups would be implemented.   Further, she admitted that the planned steps would require very close coordination with relevant government agencies (such as the Department of Social Welfare and Development, Department of Agriculture, Philippine National Police among others), local government units, social organizations and private training centers.</p>
