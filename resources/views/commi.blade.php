						<ul>
							<li>All programs of CATIAFI shall adhere to industry standards and practices.</li>
						</ul>
					<p class="title-text-style split-small-top">WELFARE</p>
						<ul>
							<li>CATIAFI shall continue to tap the services of retired TESDA employees who had excel in their  particular area of competence. For the presently employed, they are invited to partake after office hours to boost their meager income.</li>
						</ul>
					<p class="title-text-style split-small-top">REASONABLENESS</p>
						<ul>
							<li>CATIAFI will provide services with reasonable cost while maintaining quality. Making our cost lower will allow TESDA to have more programs thereby allowing more programs to offer.  We believe that serving more person is better than getting bigger income.</li>
						</ul>
					<p class="title-text-style split-small-top">AVAILABILITY</p>
						<ul>
							<li>CATIAFI can collaborate with TESDA to develop unavailable training programs in the Philippines. CATIAFI is willing to run pilot training programs. </li>
						</ul>
					<p class="title-text-style split-small-top">PROFIT</p>
						<ul>
							<li>CATIAFI exact a small margin of income from the training programs to sustain its operations.  The profit goes to the development and upgrading of training programs. </li>
